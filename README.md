# Stock Price Prediction

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices based on historical data.

## Overview

The project consists of the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Collect historical stock data using Yahoo Finance API.
2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by scaling and creating a 2D array with sliding windows.
3. Model Building: Build and train an LSTM model with Keras.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using training and validation loss, as well as other performance metrics.
5. Model Tuning: Tune hyperparameters and model architecture to improve performance.
6. Visualization: Plot actual and predicted stock prices to visualize the model's performance.
